Turn images into spreadsheets (explanation at [http://think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet](Think Maths)).

This was done for [http://think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet](Think Maths), and you may have seen it in [http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/](The Festival Of The Spoken Nerd).

The PHP file obviously won't run directly from Github, but you can try the JavaScript version at http://github.andrewt.net/mosaic

The Javascript version doesn't produce Excel files (just an HTML table) and can't handle such large images.
